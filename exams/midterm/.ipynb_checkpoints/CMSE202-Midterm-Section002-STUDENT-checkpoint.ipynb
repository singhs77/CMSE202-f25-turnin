    "The goal of this midterm is to give you the opportunity to test out some of the skills that you've developed thus far this semester. In particular, you'll practice setting up a GitHub repository, committing and pushing repository changes, downloading data with command line tools, performing some data analysis, possibly using a new Python package, and writing a python class. You should find that you have all of the skills necessary to complete this exam with even just eight weeks of CMSE 202 under your belt!\n",
    "\n",
    "You are encouraged to look through the entire exam before you get started so that you can appropriately budget your time and understand the broad goals of the exam. Once you've read through it, try doing Parts 1 and 2 first so that you have your repository set up and you download all necessary data files as they will be necessary to complete the assigned tasks. Let your instructor know right away if you have problems downloading the data!\n",
    "\n",
    "The exam is set up so that even if you get stuck on one part there are opportunities to get points on the other parts, so consider jumping ahead if you feel like you aren't making progress and then come back later if you have time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important note about using online resources**: This exam is **\"open internet\"**. That means that you can look up documentation, google how to accomplish certain Python tasks, reference and use your in-class assignments, pre-class assignments and homework, etc. Being able to effectively use the internet for computational modeling and data science is a very important skill, so we want to make sure you have the opportunity to exercise that skill. **However**: The use of any person-to-person communication software is absolutely not acceptable. If you are seen accessing your email, using a chat program (e.g. Slack), or any sort of collaborative cloud storage or document software (e.g. Google Documents), you will be at risk for receiving a zero on the exam.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important Guidelines on AI Tool Usage**\n",
    "\n",
    "This exam allows the use of AI tools (such as ChatGPT, Claude, HiTA) with specific guidelines that mirror real-world professional practices. These tools should enhance your learning and problem-solving process, not replace your intellectual engagement. Here are the key requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Appropriate Use of AI**:\n",
    "   - Use AI as a learning assistant to understand concepts, debug code, or get unstuck\n",
    "   - Use AI to improve your solution approach or verify your thinking\n",
    "   - Use AI to learn about new Python packages or functions you might need\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Prohibited Uses**:\n",
    "   - Direct copying of AI-generated solutions without understanding\n",
    "   - Asking AI to complete entire questions without your intellectual input\n",
    "   - Using AI to modify provided starter code or test cases\n",
    "   - Using AI to circumvent learning objectives or problem requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Documentation Requirements**:\n",
    "   - You must cite any AI assistance received by adding a comment that includes:\n",
    "     * The AI tool used\n",
    "     * The specific question you asked\n",
    "     * How you modified or improved upon the AI's suggestion\n",
    "   - Example: \"# AI assistance: Used Claude to understand lmfit parameter initialization. Modified the suggested approach to include custom bounds.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Evaluation Implications**:\n",
    "   - Questions showing signs of direct AI solution copying will receive zero points\n",
    "   - Evidence of not following problem instructions, even if AI-suggested, will result in zero points\n",
    "   - Modified starter code or test cases will result in zero points for that question\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember: The goal is to demonstrate your understanding and problem-solving abilities. AI tools should support your learning, not replace your critical thinking and coding skills.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: Traditional open internet resources (documentation, Stack Overflow, etc.) remain available, but person-to-person communication tools are not permitted.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Keep your eyes on your screen!** Unfortunately, there isn't enough space in the room for everyone to sit at their own table so please do your best to keep your eyes on your own screen. This exam is designed to give *you* the opportunity to show the instructor what you can do and you should hold yourself accountable for maintaining a high level of academic integrity. If any of the instructors observe suspicious behavior, you will, again, risk receiving a zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "The maximum number of points is: **88 Points**"
